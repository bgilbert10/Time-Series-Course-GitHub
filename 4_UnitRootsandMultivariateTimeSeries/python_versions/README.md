## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import and Compatibility Issues:

1. **statsmodels Version Compatibility**:
   - **Problem**: Different versions have functions in different locations
   - **Solution**: Programs include robust import handling with fallbacks:
   ```python
   try:
       from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
   except ImportError:
       try:
           from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
       except ImportError:
           from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARMA as ARIMA
   ```

2. **Unit Root Test Function Issues**:
   - **Problem**: `adfuller` function parameter changes across versions
   - **Solution**: Enhanced wrapper function handles version differences:
   ```python
   def enhanced_adf_test(series, regression='c', autolag='AIC'):
       # Handles multiple statsmodels versions
       return adfuller(series, regression=regression, autolag=autolag)
   ```

3. **SARIMAX Import Problems**:
   - **Problem**: SARIMAX location varies by statsmodels version
   - **Solution**: Multiple import attempts with graceful degradation:
   ```python
   try:
       from statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX
   except ImportError:
       SARIMAX = None  # Skip SARIMA analysis
   ```

### Data Access and API Issues:

4. **FRED Data Download Failures**:
   - Verify internet connection is stable
   - FRED servers may be temporarily unavailable
   - Some economic series may be discontinued or revised
   - Programs provide clear error messages and fallback suggestions

5. **Yahoo Finance Timeout Issues**:
   - May timeout during high-volume trading periods
   - Some financial instruments may have limited historical data
   - Programs include retry logic and alternative data sources

6. **Missing Data Handling**:
   - Programs automatically align data across different frequencies
   - Clear indication when synthetic data is used instead of real data
   - Robust handling of missing observations and data gaps

### Performance and Memory Issues:

7. **Large Dataset Memory Usage**:
   ```python
   # Downsample for memory-constrained environments
   data = data.resample('M').last()  # Monthly instead of daily/weekly
   
   # Limit analysis period
   data = data['2010':'2020']
   ```

8. **Computational Intensity Warnings**:
   ```python
   # Suppress convergence warnings for cleaner output
   import warnings
   warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=UserWarning)
   
   # Reduce maximum iterations if needed
   max_iter = 100
   ```

### Plotting and Display Issues:

9. **Matplotlib Backend Problems**:
   ```python
   # For headless systems
   import matplotlib
   matplotlib.use('Agg')
   
   # Force inline plots in Jupyter
   %matplotlib inline
   
   # Adjust figure sizes for different displays
   plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [15, 10]
   ```

10. **Seaborn Style Compatibility**:
    ```python
    # Automatic fallback for style issues
    try:
        plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8')
    except OSError:
        try:
            plt.style.use('seaborn')
        except OSError:
            plt.style.use('default')
    ```

### Statistical and Econometric Issues:

11. **Convergence Problems in ARIMA Models**:
    ```python
    # Use different optimization methods
    model = ARIMA(data, order=(p,d,q)).fit(method='css-mle')
    
    # Adjust tolerance levels
    model = ARIMA(data, order=(p,d,q)).fit(maxiter=1000, method='mle')
    ```

12. **Seasonal Modeling Complexity**:
    - Weekly seasonality (period=52) can be computationally intensive
    - Consider using Fourier terms instead of full SARIMA for long series
    - Monitor convergence warnings in seasonal models

### Debug and Diagnostics Tools:

13. **Enhanced Error Reporting**:
    ```python
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    
    # Check function availability
    print(f"ADF test available: {adfuller is not None}")
    print(f"SARIMAX available: {SARIMAX is not None}")
    ```

14. **Data Quality Checks**:
    ```python
    # Verify data integrity before analysis
    print(f"Data shape: {data.shape}")
    print(f"Missing values: {data.isnull().sum()}")
    print(f"Date range: {data.index.min()} to {data.index.max()}")
    ```

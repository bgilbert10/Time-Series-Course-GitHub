UnitRootTestingExamples.R should do the following:
Simulate persistent ar(1), ar(2), and random walk without drift with no intercepts, conduct 
unit root tests with type = none and type = drift (i.e., with and without an intercept) using 
cadftest() (so that students will know how to include covariates) for the individual test and 
ur.df() so that students will know how to conduct joint tests with the unit root test, then 
simulate persistent ar(1) and ar(2) with intercepts and RW without drift and test each with 
no intercept then with intercept then with trend (type = none, drift, or trend) using both 
individual and joint tests (cadftest() and ur.df()) and estimate an arima on the RW to show 
that the intercept estimate is zero, Finally simulate a persistent ar(1) with trend and a RW 
with drift and do individual and joint tests with drift and trend, and check arima intercept
Then do an application to oil prices, natural gas prices, and a drilling activity index: 
download oil, gas, and drilling data, chart them, find their AR(p) lag order and do individual 
and joint tests with and without trend (what my code calls Case 2 and Case 4). 
InClassExampleUnitRootsGold.R should do the following: 
Get macro and oil price data, convert to monthly, merge, test each series for unit roots 
using individual and joint tests with drift and trend, then download separate gold and 
macro data and do a similar plotting and unit root testing exercise on each. 
SeasonalityUnitRootsGasInventories.R should do the following: 
Read and format natural gas storage inventory data, conduct unit root tests using the 
cadftest() function that allows for covariates and include Fourier terms to deal with 
seasonality, residualize the storage inventory series from Fourier terms to get a 
deseasonalized inventory series and test that for unit roots in order to illustrate different 
components of the original data series, select an arima model based on the results of the 
unit root testing and including fourier series terms, do diagnostics on the residuals of that 
model: acf, pacf, sequential ljung box test, compare results to an automatic model 
selection procedure for arima terms controlling for fourier terms, forecast on a holdout 
sample, then conduct on automatic model selection for a SARIMA model without fourier 
terms and forecast that on a holdout sample and compare this model to previous ones and 
compare their forecasts.
